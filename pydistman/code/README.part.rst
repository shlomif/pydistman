PURPOSE
-------

A work-in-progress manager for PyPI-like python distributions which aims to
be a "maximum overkill" don't-repeat yourself manager with a user
experience similar to Dist Zilla ( http://dzil.org/ ).

Currently it is functional, but a far cry from our vision.

INSTALLATION
------------

pip3 install pydistman
